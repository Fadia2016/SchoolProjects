The code is to determene whether the Number is perfect number or not using multithreads. The code was written using C++. the code takes two argumentes where the first is the number and the second is number of thread.

for Example: ./perfect_Number 28 3

28 is the Number that you want to know if it is perfect or not
3 is the number of threads 

The output will be 0,1 or 2;

0 if the number is perfect 1 if Not a perfect Number. 2 Error or wrong input.

to see the output...in the command line type: echo $?

Note: The Number of threads should be bigger than 0 and smaller than the Number.
